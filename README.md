# Custom RC Airplane: Hardware, Configs & 3D Parts
Building a custom RC airplane often involves piecing together information from scattered sources—finding the right electronics, figuring out radio mixes, and designing mechanical parts.

This repository aims to bridge that gap by centralizing the resources I used in my own build. It documents the integration of the RadioMaster ecosystem (EdgeTX/ELRS) with standard RC components, along with custom 3D modeled parts I designed to improve the airframe.

Whether you are an intermediate hobbyist or looking for specific configurations for the ER8 and Pocket, you will find practical, field-tested resources here.
