#  Custom Cockpit Canopy

This is a basic cockpit model intended to serve as a reference or a base for your own designs.

## Design Process
To achieve a perfect fit with the fuselage, I used the following method:

1.  **Measurement:** I measured the dimensions (length, width, and height) of the "void space" available on the airplane fuselage where the cockpit sits.
2.  **Modeling:** Using **Fusion 360**, I created a solid block with the canopy's general aesthetic shape.
3.  **Boolean Operation:** I used the measured dimensions to make precise cuts (Boolean subtraction) on the model.

**Result:** The cockpit has the exact footprint required to snap into the fuselage while maintaining a streamlined aerodynamic profile.
