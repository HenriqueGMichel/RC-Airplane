  Hey! This is an landing gear that i designed for be pratical to build and easy to print. It has suspension with an spring that i bought in AliExpress. 
  I made for RC Airplane's that had to be at least 15 centimeters from the floor, that's why it has two parts in the main body.
  The things i bought for it:
Steel Spring with 1.5mm of wire diameter and 25mm of external diameter. I would say it need to have at least 300mm of lenght
For holding the Part 1 and Part 2 together i used Carbon Fiber Hod which i already had for reinforce the Airplane, it has 2mm of diameter.
And for the part of the middle i used the commom Push Rod cutted in the right size. 
I used super glue for some parts and hot glue for others.

  This project i modelled to use thing's that i had already bought for my Airplane except by the spring
